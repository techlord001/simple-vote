# Simple Vote

This project is designed to showcase both Vue & Laravel understanding both in isolation and in tandem.

Visitors are able to, using an email, register themselves, login, and cast a single vote for the set question.

When a vote is cast, a user's IP address and Location are recorded.

Votes are queued and a summary of results are sent out by email everyday at 23:59.

## Built With
